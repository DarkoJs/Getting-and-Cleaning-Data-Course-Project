# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
:goal_net: **collect, work with, and clean a data set**

The goal of the project is to prepare tidy data based on Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set, that can be used for later analysis. 

The project repo includes the following files: 

* A README.md 
* A tidy data set named "tidy_data_set/txt".
* a CodeBook.md code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data.
* A (link here)[https://github.com/DarkoJs/Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project] to the Github repository with all the scripts/files listed above
R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:





The review criteria of the project are: 

1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.



You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 
The R script is called run_analysis.R and it does the following: 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
